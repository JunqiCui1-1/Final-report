- For each `(ID, rel_hour, variable)`, keep the row with the largest `h` within that bin (the last measurement in the window).
- Build the patient × time skeleton by cross-joining all IDs with `rel_hour ∈ {10,12,…,720}`, then left-join the binned variables.
- Leave missing values as `NaN` and add `<var>_obs ∈ {0,1}` per bin to indicate whether any record landed in that bin.

## What gets built

For every patient and each 2-hour bin (right endpoints `10, 12, …, 720` from t0 by absolute value), the panel contains the **last observation in the bin** for:
- `Albumin`, `Creatinine`, `Hemoglobin`, `Potassium`, `Sodium`

Each lab also has a `<var>_obs` flag (`0/1`) marking whether anything was observed in that bin.  
**All patients** from the base cohort appear; **missing** values remain `NaN`.

## Output Schema (wide panel)

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subject_id` / `patientunitstayid` | int | Patient identifier (depends on pipeline) |
| `rel_hour` | int | Right endpoint of the 2h bin in `{10, 12, …, 720}` |
| `Albumin` … `Sodium` | float | Last value observed within the bin; `NaN` if none |
| `Albumin_obs` … `Sodium_obs` | int (0/1) | `1` if any record landed in the bin; else `0` |

---

## Coverage Report

At completion, the script prints a **unique-ID-level** coverage dictionary:
- For each variable: `(covered_ids, total_ids, percent)`
- An ID is counted as **covered** if any bin has `_obs = 1` for that variable.

---

## Error Handling & Robustness

- Case-insensitive column detection with multiple aliases.
- Minutes vs hours auto-detected by median magnitude (`|median| > 500` ⇒ minutes).
- If a variable file fails, the pipeline continues with an all-missing placeholder for that variable.
- If a row has absolute time but the subject lacks a parsed `t0`, its relative hours are `NaN` and it won’t enter bins (the subject still exists in the skeleton with `_obs = 0` for that variable).

---

## Why this is model-friendly

- Fixed **patient × time** grid enables straightforward batching for temporal models.
- Positive time `|hours|` places pre- and post-op magnitudes on one axis; add a separate sign channel later if needed.
- “Last value per bin” gives a robust down-sampling of irregular clinical series.
- Observation flags (`_obs`) let models reason explicitly about missingness.

## Quick Start

1. Place the base file and the five lab files under `/content/`.
2. Run the script for your pipeline.
3. Find the output wide panel at the path listed in the pipeline’s **Output** above.

## Customize

- **Window / bin size**: edit `ABS_START_H = 8`, `ABS_END_H = 30*24`, `BIN_H = 2`.
- **Add variables**: extend `VAR_FILES` with `"NewVar": "/content/newvar.csv"`.
- **Keep sign information**: produce an auxiliary signed-time feature/channel if required by the model.
